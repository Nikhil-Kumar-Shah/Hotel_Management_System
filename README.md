## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Hotel Management System up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x and MySQL installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the project from GitHub using the command line:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nikhil-Kumar-Shah/Hotel_Management_System.git
    cd Hotel_Management_System
    ```

2.  **Install Required Libraries**
    The project relies on the `PyMySQL` library to connect to the MySQL database. Install it using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install pymysql
    ```

3.  **Database Setup**
    Set up the database and its tables by executing the SQL commands provided in `Hotel_Management_System_database.txt`.

      * Open your MySQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench or a command-line interface).
      * Run the provided SQL script to create the `hotel_db` database and its tables (`rooms`, `customers`, and `billing`).

4.  **Configure Database Connection**
    Open the `Hotel_Management_System.py` file and update the database connection details to match your MySQL server's credentials:

    ```python
    conn = pymysql.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="your_mysql_user", # Replace with your MySQL username
        password="your_mysql_password", # Replace with your MySQL password
        database="hotel_db"
    )
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    Once the setup is complete, you can start the application from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python Hotel_Management_System.py
    ```

    The main menu will be displayed, and you can begin managing the hotel.

## üìú Database Schema

The database is structured to support the application's core functions with three main tables:

**`rooms`**
Stores information about each room.

  * `RoomID`: Primary key, auto-incrementing.

**`customers`**
Holds customer details and their room assignment.

  * `CustomerID`: Primary key, auto-incrementing.

  * `RoomID`: Foreign key referencing `rooms`, can be null if the customer has checked out.

**`billing`**
Manages billing records for customers.

  * `BillID`: Primary key, auto-incrementing.
  * `CustomerID`: Foreign key referencing `customers`.
  * `Amount`: The total amount of the bill.
